Let's approach this problem step by step, considering both frontend and backend, and also the network in between.

Step 1: Check the Network Tab in Browser Developer Tools
Open the browser's developer tools and go to the Network tab. Try to log in and see if any request is made to the server.

If no request is made, the problem is likely in the frontend JavaScript code (e.g., form submission is prevented by an error in the code).

If a request is made, check the response status and body.

Step 2: Check the Console for Errors
Look for any JavaScript errors in the Console tab of the developer tools. These errors might prevent the login request from being sent.

Step 3: Check the Backend Logs
If the request is being sent, check the backend logs (Django server logs) to see if the request is received and if there are any errors in processing.

Step 4: Check the Django View for Login
Ensure that the Django view for login is correctly set up to handle the request. This includes:

The URL routing is correct.

The view function is being called.

The view function returns a response.

Step 5: Check for CSRF Issues
Django requires CSRF protection for POST requests. If the frontend is not sending the CSRF token, the request will be rejected.

Step 6: Check the Authentication Backend
Ensure that the authentication backend is correctly set up and that the user exists in the database.

Step 7: Check the Database Connection
If the database is not accessible, the authentication will fail.

Step 8: Check the Server Configuration
If the application is in production, check the server configuration (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to ensure that the request is being proxied correctly to the Django application.

Step 9: Check for Firewall or Security Group Settings
Ensure that the server is accessible on the required port.

Step 10: Check the Django Settings
Check the settings.py for any misconfigurations, such as:

ALLOWED_HOSTS

CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST (if the frontend is on a different domain)

CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS

Step 11: Check the Request Payload
Ensure that the frontend is sending the data in the format expected by the backend (e.g., JSON, form data).

Step 12: Check the User Model
If using a custom user model, ensure that the authentication is using the correct model and that the user's password is stored correctly.

Step 13: Check the Middleware
Django middleware can sometimes block requests. Check the middleware stack in settings.py.

Step 14: Check the Authentication Middleware
Ensure that django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware is in the MIDDLEWARE setting.

Step 15: Check the Session Middleware
Ensure that django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware is in the MIDDLEWARE setting.

Step 16: Check the HTTP to HTTPS Redirect
If the site is using HTTPS, ensure that the login request is not being redirected from HTTP to HTTPS in a way that breaks the POST request (e.g., 301 redirect for POST may cause the request to become GET).

Step 17: Check the Django Version
There might be a known issue in the Django version being used.

Step 18: Check the Browser for SameSite Cookie Issues
Some browsers (like Chrome) have strict SameSite cookie policies. Ensure that the cookies are set with the appropriate SameSite attribute.

Step 19: Check for Ad Blockers or Browser Extensions
Sometimes, browser extensions can block requests. Try disabling them.

Step 20: Check the Django CSRF Cookie Settings
Ensure that the CSRF cookie is being set and sent with the request.

Step 21: Check the Django CSRF View Middleware
Ensure that django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware is in the MIDDLEWARE setting.

Step 22: Check the Django CSRF Token in the Form
If using a Django template, ensure that the {% csrf_token %} template tag is included in the form.

Step 23: Check the AJAX Request for CSRF Token
If using AJAX, ensure that the CSRF token is included in the request headers.

Step 24: Check the Django Login View
If using Django's built-in login view, ensure that it is configured correctly.

Step 25: Check the Django User Authentication
Test the user authentication in the Django shell.

Step 26: Check the Password Hashing
Ensure that the password hashing algorithm is consistent and that the password is being hashed correctly.

Step 27: Check the Django Logs
Check the Django logs for any errors that might not be displayed in the server response.

Step 28: Check the Server Error Logs
Check the server error logs (e.g., Nginx error log) for any errors.

Step 29: Check the Database for User
Ensure that the user exists in the database and that the password is correct.

Step 30: Check the Django Auth URLs
Ensure that the login URL is included in the urls.py and that it is pointing to the correct view.

Step 31: Check the Django Auth View
If using Django's LoginView, ensure that the template and form are correctly set up.

Step 32: Check the Django Auth Form
If using a custom authentication form, ensure that it is correctly validating the user.

Step 33: Check the Django Auth Backend
If using a custom authentication backend, ensure that it is correctly authenticating the user.

Step 34: Check the Django Auth User Model
If using a custom user model, ensure that the USERNAME_FIELD is set correctly and that the model is correctly defined.

Step 35: Check the Django Auth Password Validation
Ensure that the password validation is not preventing the user from logging in.

If the user is being logged out immediately, check the session configuration.

Step 41: Check the Django Auth Login Required
If the user is being redirected to the login page, check the LOGIN_URL setting.

Step 42: Check the Django Auth Login Redirect
Check the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL setting.

Step 43: Check the Django Auth Logout Redirect
Check the LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL setting.

Step 44: Check the Django Auth Password Reset

Given the complexity and the fact that the user has tried many solutions, I would recommend starting from the top and going step by step. However, since the user says "no all of them applied", it might be that the issue is in a place that we haven't considered.

Let me try to provide a more focused approach:

Focused Approach
Check the Django server logs: This is the first place to look for errors. If there are no errors in the logs, then the request is not reaching the Django server.

Check the web server logs (if using Nginx or Apache): If the request is being blocked by the web server, it won't reach Django.

Check the browser's Network tab: This will show if the request is being sent and what the response is.

Check the browser's Console tab: This will show any JavaScript errors.

Check the Django settings for ALLOWED_HOSTS: If the domain is not in ALLOWED_HOSTS, Django will return a 400 error.

Check the Django settings for CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS: If the request is coming from a different origin (e.g., frontend on a different port) and you are using CSRF, you need to add the origin to CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS.

Check the Django settings for CORS: If the frontend is on a different domain, you need to handle CORS.

Check the Django view for login: Ensure that the view is correctly handling the request and returning a response.

Check the Django authentication: Ensure that the user is being authenticated correctly.

Check the Django session: Ensure that the session is being created correctly.
