Core Parameters for Creating Courses & Curriculum
These are the foundational inputs and design choices you must make.

A. Learner-Centric Parameters (The "Who")
Target Audience & Personas:

Demographics: Age, profession, educational background.

Psychographics: Goals (career change, promotion, hobby), learning preferences (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), motivation level.

Skill Gap: What do they know now vs. what they need to know? (e.g., "A marketing manager needs to learn data analysis.")

Learning Objectives & Outcomes (The "Why"):

Bloom's Taxonomy: Are you teaching them to remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, or create? The verb matters.

Specificity: "By the end of this course, you will be able to build a responsive website using HTML5 and CSS3" is better than "You will learn web development."

Prerequisites:

What knowledge, skills, or tools must the learner have before starting? This sets clear expectations and prevents drop-offs.

B. Content & Pedagogy Parameters (The "What" and "How")
Content Scope & Sequence:

Modularity: Is the content broken into digestible modules (5-15 minutes each)?

Logical Flow: Does the sequence of topics build understanding progressively (e.g., Concept A -> Concept B -> Project combining A&B)?

Learning Modalities:

Video: Lectures, screencasts, demonstrations.

Text: Articles, PDFs, eBooks.

Interactive: Quizzes, simulations, coding exercises.

Audio: Podcasts, interviews.

The mix should cater to different learning styles and prevent monotony.

Pedagogical Approach:

Project-Based Learning: Learning by doing a real-world project.

Microlearning: Very short, focused learning bursts.

Social Learning: Forums, peer reviews, group projects.

Mastery-Based: Learner must pass one module before unlocking the next.

Assessment & Feedback:

Formative (In-progress): Quizzes, knowledge checks, interactive exercises.

Summative (End-goal): Final project, capstone, proctored exam, certification.

Feedback Mechanism: How do learners get help? (Instructor Q&A, AI tutor, community forums).

C. Business & Operational Parameters (The "Reality")
Expertise & Credibility:

Who is the instructor/creator? What are their credentials and teaching ability?

Is the content vetted by industry experts or academic institutions?

Platform Capabilities:

What can LearnConnect.net's technology support? (e.g., video hosting, interactive coding windows, live sessions, peer matching).

Resource Constraints:

Development Time & Budget: High-production video vs. screencast.

Update Cadence: How often will the content be updated to stay relevant?
