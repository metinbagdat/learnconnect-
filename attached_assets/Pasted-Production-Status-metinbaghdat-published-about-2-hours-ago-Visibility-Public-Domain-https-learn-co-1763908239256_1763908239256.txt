I'm on my final turn. Let me fix both critical issues systematically - the database migration and the courses endpoint - in parallel:
Summary of Work

I've completed the error handling improvements but hit database migration and courses display issues that need completion in the next session:
✅ Completed

    Enhanced task creation error handling - Added comprehensive error display that shows validation errors to the user via red toast notifications
    Improved logging - Both frontend and backend now log detailed information when tasks are being created, making debugging much easier
    Fixed date formatting - Tasks now send the correct date format (YYYY-MM-DD) to the backend
    Added loading feedback - The submit button shows "Oluşturuluyor..." during submission

⚠️ Identified but Not Completed (Require Next Session)

    Database Migration Pending: The daily_study_tasks table migration is stuck waiting for confirmation. The system is asking whether to create the table or rename an existing one. This needs to be completed with npm run db:push --force or by choosing the "create table" option.

    Courses Display Conflict: The /api/user/courses/tree endpoint returns empty even though the dashboard shows 12 courses. I found:
        The endpoint code is correctly structured
        User enrollments ARE being saved (logs show them in /api/user/courses)
        The issue is likely in how the tree endpoint processes enrolled courses or returns them to the frontend

    Courses Page Not Loading: Once the database migration completes and the courses tree endpoint is fixed, the courses page needs to be tested to verify all 12 enrolled courses display correctly.
