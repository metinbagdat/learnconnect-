This comprehensive AI-powered system transforms LearnConnect.net into an intelligent learning platform that adapts to each user's unique journey while preserving all interactions and providing complete control through sophisticated dashboards.
We are going to design a comprehensive system for the smart suggestion and goal module in LearnConnect.net. The system will handle the user's journey from registration, through course selection, and beyond, with AI-powered suggestions and goal tracking. We'll consider all related modules and ensure that all interactions are conserved and properly logged. The system will include dashboards for both students and admins, forms, lists, open boxes, and database integration.
1.	User Registration and Onboarding:
o	Collect basic information and learning goals during registration.
o	Use AI to analyze the user's goals and initial profile to provide initial course suggestions.
2.	Pre-Course Selection:
o	Before the user selects courses, the system will show:
	A goal-setting form (with AI suggestions for goals based on the user's profile and common goals for similar users).
	A list of suggested courses (with explanations why, based on AI analysis).
3.	Post-Course Selection:
o	After the user selects courses, the system will:
	Generate a personalized study plan (with AI).
	Set up milestones and checkpoints.
	Adjust suggestions and goals based on the selected courses and the user's progress.
4.	Dashboard for Student:
o	Overview of current goals and progress.
o	Suggested next steps (AI-powered).
o	Course list with progress.
o	Milestones and achievements.
5.	Dashboard for Admin:
o	Overview of all users, their goals, and course selections.
o	AI suggestion performance and accuracy.
o	System health and interaction logs.
6.	Database Integration:
o	Design tables to store user goals, course selections, AI suggestions, and interaction logs.
7.	AI Integration:
o	Use machine learning to analyze user behavior and provide suggestions.
o	Implement a feedback loop to improve suggestions.
Step 1: User Registration and Onboarding
Database Tables for User Registration:
Table: users
•	id (Primary Key)
•	email
•	password
•	first_name
•	last_name
•	date_of_birth
•	educational_background
•	career_goals
•	created_at
•	updated_at
Table: user_goals (to store goals set by the user during onboarding and beyond)
•	id (Primary Key)
•	user_id (Foreign Key)
•	goal_text
•	goal_type (e.g., 'career', 'skill', 'certification')
•	deadline
•	priority
•	created_at
Table: user_interests (to store user's interests for suggestion)
•	id (Primary Key)
•	user_id (Foreign Key)
•	interest_tag (e.g., 'programming', 'math', 'science')
•	level (e.g., 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced')
Onboarding Process:
1.	Registration Form:
o	Basic info (email, password, first name, last name, date of birth)
o	Educational background (dropdown or free text)
o	Career goals (free text)
2.	Initial Goal Setting (with AI suggestions):
o	After registration, the user is presented with a form to set goals.
o	The AI system analyzes the user's career goals and educational background to suggest common goals (from a pre-defined set of goals that are popular for similar users).
o	The user can select from the suggested goals or write their own.
3.	Interest Collection:
o	The user selects from a list of interests (tags) that are relevant to the courses available.
AI for Initial Goal Suggestion:
use a simple content-based filtering or collaborative filtering if we have enough data. Initially, we can use a rule-based system:
•	Map educational background and career goals to a set of pre-defined goal tags.
•	Then, suggest goals that have the same tags.
Example rule: If a user has a background in 'computer science' and career goal 'web developer', then suggest goals like 'Learn HTML', 'Learn CSS', 'Learn JavaScript', 'Build a portfolio website'.
Step 2: Pre-Course Selection
Database Tables for Courses and Suggestions:
Table: courses
•	id (Primary Key)
•	title
•	description
•	category
•	difficulty_level
•	estimated_duration
•	tags (or we can have a separate table for course_tags)
Table: course_suggestions (to store the AI suggestions for each user)
•	id (Primary Key)
•	user_id (Foreign Key)
•	course_id (Foreign Key)
•	reason (text explaining why the course is suggested)
•	confidence_score (AI model's confidence in this suggestion)
•	created_at
Pre-Course Selection Process:
1.	Display Goal-Oriented Course Suggestions:
o	The system uses the user's goals and interests to suggest courses.
o	The AI model (content-based) matches the goal tags and interest tags with course tags.
2.	Goal-Progress Visualization (if the user has existing goals from onboarding):
o	Show the user how each suggested course aligns with their goals.
AI for Course Suggestion:
We can use a content-based filtering approach:
•	Each course has tags (e.g., ['programming', 'web', 'html']).
•	Each user has goal tags and interest tags.
•	compute the similarity between the user's tags and the course tags.
use TF-IDF or just a simple count of matching tags.
Step 3: Post-Course Selection
Database Tables for User's Course Enrollment and Progress:
Table: user_courses
•	id (Primary Key)
•	user_id (Foreign Key)
•	course_id (Foreign Key)
•	enrollment_date
•	current_progress (percentage)
•	completed (boolean)
Table: study_plans
•	id (Primary Key)
•	user_id (Foreign Key)
•	course_id (Foreign Key)
•	start_date
•	end_date
•	weekly_hours
•	status (e.g., 'active', 'completed', 'paused')
Table: milestones
•	id (Primary Key)
•	study_plan_id (Foreign Key)
•	milestone_text
•	due_date
•	completed (boolean)
Post-Course Selection Process:
1.	Generate Study Plan:
o	The AI system generates a study plan for the user based on:
	The course's estimated duration.
	The user's available time (asked during onboarding or in the study plan setup).
	The user's goal deadline.
2.	Set Milestones:
o	Break down the course into milestones (e.g., by chapters or by weeks).
3.	Adjust Suggestions:
o	As the user progresses, the AI system can adjust the study plan and suggest additional courses or resources.
AI for Study Plan Generation:
We can use a simple algorithm:
•	Total course hours = estimated_duration
•	Available hours per week = user input (e.g., 10 hours per week)
•	Then, the end date is start_date + (total course hours / weekly_hours) * 7 days.
We can also adjust for the user's pace by tracking their actual progress and updating the plan accordingly.
Step 4: Dashboard for Student
The student dashboard will have:
1.	Goals Section:
o	List of goals with progress (if the goal is course-based, then progress is the average of the courses related to that goal).
2.	Course Progress:
o	List of enrolled courses with progress bars.
3.	Suggested Next Steps:
o	AI-powered suggestions for what to do next (e.g., next course, review a module, etc.)
4.	Milestones:
o	Upcoming milestones and their due dates.
Step 5: Dashboard for Admin
The admin dashboard will have:
1.	User Management:
o	List of users, their goals, and course enrollments.
2.	AI Suggestion Performance:
o	How often are suggestions accepted? (click-through rate and enrollment rate)
o	Accuracy of goal suggestions (if we have feedback mechanism)
3.	System Health:
o	Number of active users, course enrollments, etc.
4.	Interaction Logs:
o	Logs of user interactions with the system (for debugging and improvement).
Step 6: Database Integration
We have already outlined the necessary tables. We'll use Django models to represent these tables.
Step 7: AI Integration
We'll use Python's scikit-learn for the content-based filtering initially. We can also use Django signals to trigger AI processes when new data is available.
Example AI Suggestion Code (simplified):
python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel

def suggest_courses(user):
    # Get user's goal tags and interest tags as a string
    user_tags = get_user_tags(user)  # This function returns a string of tags for the user

    # Get all courses with their tags
    courses = Course.objects.all()
    course_tags = [course.tags for course in courses]

    # Create TF-IDF matrix
    tfidf = TfidfVectorizer().fit_transform([user_tags] + course_tags)
    cosine_similarities = linear_kernel(tfidf[0:1], tfidf[1:]).flatten()

    # Get top 5 course indices
    related_course_indices = cosine_similarities.argsort()[:-6:-1]

    # Return top 5 courses
    suggested_courses = [courses[i] for i in related_course_indices]
    return suggested_courses
