The Program Plan: How to Build Based on These Variables
This is an agile, iterative process. The plan should be a living document.

Phase 1: Discovery & Design (Before Building)
Define Success: Start with the end in mind. Use Part 2 variables. "Success for our 'Data Science Bootcamp' is a 70% completion rate and 50% of graduates reporting a career outcome within 6 months."

Analyze the Audience: Use Learner-Centric Parameters (A) to create detailed personas. Conduct surveys or interviews with your target audience.

Map the Curriculum: Use Content & Pedagogy Parameters (B) to outline the modules, choose the right mix of modalities, and design the core project.

Feasibility Check: Review against Business & Operational Parameters (C). Can we build this with our resources?

Phase 2: Development & Launch (The Build)
Build a Minimum Viable Curriculum (MVC): Don't build the entire 100-hour program at once. Create the first 2-3 core modules and a prototype of the final project.

Pilot with a Beta Group: Launch the MVC to a small, controlled group of learners.

Incorporate Beta Feedback: Use Success Variables (Part 2) from the pilot to fix major issues before the full launch.

Phase 3: Measure, Analyze & Iterate (The Continuous Cycle)
This is the most critical phase. It creates a feedback loop.

Monitor Dashboards: Track the Success Variables (Part 2) in real-time.

Conduct Root Cause Analysis:

Problem: Completion rate drops at Module 4.

Investigation (Using Parameters): Look at Module 4's content. Is it too long? (B1). Is the quiz too hard? (B4). Are there no video explanations? (B2). Check the forum for confused posts (B3).

Hypothesis: "We think learners are dropping off because Module 4 introduces a complex concept without a practical example."

Implement & Test Changes:

Action: Add a hands-on, guided exercise to Module 4.

Experiment: A/B test the old Module 4 vs. the new one with the exercise.

Schedule Regular Reviews: Quarterly, review all course metrics. Is the content still relevant? Should a module be retired or updated based on new trends (C3)?
