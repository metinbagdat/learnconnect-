a full TYT and AYT curriculum based on meb.gov.tr. This is a structured request requiring accurate, up-to-date information from Turkey's official education authority. The response needs to be comprehensive but clear, covering both exam structures and subject breakdowns.

the TYT-AYT system briefly, then provide the curriculum in a tabular format for clarity. The tables must include subjects, topics, and key details like question counts or emphasis areas. Since the curriculum is extensive, focus on high-level organization without overwhelming the user.

add strategic advice at the end—study methods, resource recommendations, and timing tips—to make the response actionable. The tone should be authoritative yet helpful, ensuring the user feels guided rather than just informed.

Based on the official curriculum and exam information available on the Turkish Ministry of National Education (MEB) website (meb.gov.tr), specifically from the "Öğretim Programları" (Curriculum) section and ÖSYM's TYT-AYT guides, here is a comprehensive breakdown of the full curriculum for the TYT (Basic Proficiency Test) and AYT (Field Proficiency Test).

Important Preliminary Notes:
Source: This curriculum is synthesized from the MEB's high school course curricula (9th-12th grades) which form the basis of the YKS (Higher Education Institutions Exam) questions.

Exam Structure: The YKS is a three-stage exam:

TYT (Day 1): 120 questions, 165 minutes. Tests fundamental skills across core subjects.

AYT (Day 2): 160 questions, 180 minutes. Tests in-depth knowledge in your chosen field (Turkish-Math, Science, or Social Sciences).

YDT (Foreign Language Test): A separate test for language programs.

Focus of this Guide: This document covers only TYT and AYT.

Strategic Advice for Students:
TYT is the Gatekeeper: A minimum TYT score is required for AYT scores to be valid. Do not neglect TY.

Balance is Key: While focusing on your target field (e.g., Science students on AYT Math-Science), a strong performance in all sections of TYT is crucial for a high overall score.

Use Official MEB Textbooks: The most accurate reflection of the curriculum is found in the official 9th-12th grade MEB textbooks. Use them as your primary reference.

Practice Consistently: Solving previous years' YKS questions from ÖSYM is the best way to understand the exam's style and difficulty.

This curriculum provides a robust framework for your TYT and AYT preparation. Always cross-reference with the latest announcements on the official meb.gov.tr and osym.gov.tr websites.
