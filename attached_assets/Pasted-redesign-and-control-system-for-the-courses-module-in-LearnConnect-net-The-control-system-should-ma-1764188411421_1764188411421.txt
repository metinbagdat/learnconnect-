redesign and control system for the courses module in LearnConnect.net. The control system should manage all aspects of the courses module and its interactions with other modules. consider the following:
1.	Course Management (CRUD operations)
2.	Course Content Management (modules, lessons, materials)
3.	User Enrollment and Progress Tracking
4.	Course Recommendations
5.	Integration with Study Planner
6.	Analytics and Reporting
7.	Permissions and Access Control
create a centralized control system that coordinates these aspects and ensures data consistency and a smooth user experience.
1.	Define the Course Control System Architecture
2.	Implement Course Management
3.	Implement Content Management
4.	Implement User Enrollment and Progress Tracking
5.	Implement Course Recommendations
6.	Integrate with Study Planner
7.	Implement Analytics and Reporting
8.	Set up Permissions and Access Control
9.	Ensure Data Consistency and Error Handling
10.	Monitor and Logging
Step 1: Course Control System Architecture
create a CourseControl class that will act as the main controller for all course-related operations. It will coordinate between various sub-modules.
Step 2: Course Management
•	Create, read, update, delete courses.
•	Course metadata (title, description, instructor, duration, etc.)
Step 3: Content Management
•	Manage modules and lessons within a course.
•	Handle different types of content (videos, texts, quizzes, assignments).
Step 4: User Enrollment and Progress Tracking
•	Enroll users in courses.
•	Track progress (completed lessons, scores, etc.).
Step 5: Course Recommendations
•	Recommend courses to users based on their interests, past activities, and similar users.
Step 6: Integration with Study Planner
•	The study planner should be able to get the course content and schedule it for the user.
Step 7: Analytics and Reporting
•	Generate reports on course performance, user engagement, etc.
Step 8: Permissions and Access Control
•	Control who can create courses, who can enroll, and who can access what.
Step 9: Data Consistency and Error Handling
•	Ensure that all operations are atomic and consistent.
•	Proper error handling and user feedback.
Step 10: Monitor and Logging
•	Log important events and monitor the health of the course module.
Arrange structure for the Course Control System.
create a CourseControl class that will have methods for various operations and will use other classes for specific functionality.
create separate classes for:
•	CourseManager: for course CRUD operations
•	ContentManager: for managing course content
•	EnrollmentManager: for managing enrollments and progress
•	RecommendationEngine: for course recommendations
•	CourseAnalytics: for analytics and reporting
•	CoursePermissions: for access control
The CourseControl class will initialize these managers and provide a unified interface.
