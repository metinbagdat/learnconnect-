place that need consolidation  for i18n systems. examine both translation files completely to create a unified system: scope of our consolidation task.  Unify two separate i18n systems 
•	35+ components using useLanguage from different sources
•	Two translation systems with different focus areas: 
o	language-context.tsx - Smart suggestions, subscription management
o	use-language.tsx - Core UI, navigation, auth, dashboard
consolidate these into a single comprehensive translation system: 
use-language.tsx - 700+ keys (Core UI, navigation, auth, courses)
language-context.tsx - 200+ keys (Smart suggestions, subscriptions)
35+ components using different systems
created a comprehensive consolidated translation system with 1,000+ translation keys covering all areas of our platform:
