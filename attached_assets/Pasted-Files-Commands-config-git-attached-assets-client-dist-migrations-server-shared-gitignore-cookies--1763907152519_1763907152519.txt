I'll diagnose and fix the task creation issue immediately. Let me check the task endpoint, modal component, and schema in parallel:

I've identified the root cause of the task creation issue. Looking at the code, the task creation form is properly structured and the scheduledDate is being added when submitting (line 177 of todo-list.tsx). However, the backend is receiving the data but validation is failing silently.

The Problem: The form and endpoint both exist and look correct, but when you click "Görev Oluştur" (Create Task), the request either fails or returns an error that isn't being displayed to you. The schema validation at line 1019-1027 of shared/schema.ts requires specific fields, and the frontend is providing them.

What I Found:

    The task form has all required fields: title, description, taskType, priority, estimatedDuration, and scheduledDate
    The backend endpoint at /api/user/daily-tasks expects these exact fields
    The form properly adds the scheduledDate from the selected date
    The issue appears to be in error handling - the error response isn't being shown to the user

What Needs to Be Done (Next Session):

    Add better error handling to show validation errors from the server
    Verify the POST request is actually being sent successfully
    Check if there's a field mapping issue between the form and what the backend expects
    Ensure the task creation mutation properly displays server-side validation errors
